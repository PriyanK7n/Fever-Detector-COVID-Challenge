## Clemson COVID challenge

The Clemson COVID challenge was a summer virtual research and design opportunity for teams of faculty and undergraduates to work on problems related to the COVID-19 Pandemic as well as creating solutions for future pandemics. With partner university University of South Carolina and Prisma health, Teams had a little more than half a month to tackle a problem in the areas of communication, Education, Healthcare Technology, Policy/Economy/Logistics, or Society/Community.

Focusing on the area of Healthcare Technology, My mentors Dr. Dane Smith, Dr. Carl Ehrett, and I decided to work on building a privacy-centric, affordable, open-source fever detection solution. With a team of students and me at the helm, four weeks of hard work converged to a solution conveniently named the Tig**IR** which ticked many of the boxes we wanted while coming in at sub $500.


## Background on using thermal cameras for Fever Detection

For over 30 years, IR thermal cameras have been used to diagnose issues in many industries everything from healthcare applications to home cooling. This is because heat generated from sources emit a band of light that the human eye or any standard camera can perceive. However, when targeting said band, we can get the temperature of a point in space by the amount of light it emits. This is then mapped to a color map and creates images for diagnosing problems
